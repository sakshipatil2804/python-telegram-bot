Create a Telegram Bot using Python
Requirements
A Telegram Account: If you don’t have the Telegram app installed just download it from the play store. After downloading create an account using your mobile number just like WhatsApp.
.python-telegram-bot module: Here we will need a module called python-telegram-bot, This library provides a pure Python interface for the Telegram Bot API. It’s compatible with Python versions 3.6.8+. In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features a number of high-level classes to make the development of bots easy and straightforward. These classes are contained in the “telegram.ext” submodule. For more information, you can check their official GitHub repo.
Installation of the module
We can install this module via pip and conda with the below command.

# installing via pip
pip install python-telegram-bot

# installing via conda
conda install -c conda-forge python-telegram-bot
Steps to create your first bot
Step 1: After opening an account on Telegram, in the search bar at the top search for “BotFather”

Step 2: Click on the ‘BotFather’ (first result) and type /newbot

Step 3: Give a unique name to your bot. After naming it, Botfather will ask for its username. Then also give a unique name BUT remember the username of your bot must end with the bot, like my_bot, hellobot etc.

Step 4: After giving a unique name and if it gets accepted you will get a message something like this –

Here the token value will be different for you, we will use this token in our python code to make changes in our bot and make it just like we want, and add some commands in it.
